## BlackJack Project

### Overview
This application is a functional command line Blackjack game.This game is based off of a traditional 21 Blackjack game. The game begins with the player starting with money and then being asked how much they would like to bet. If the player beats the dealers hand they win the money they bet and if they lose they lose the money they bet. The player continues to play until they just keep winning, lose all of their money, or exit the game. 

### Technologies Used
* Java
* Enums
* Object Oriented design
* Git
* Google
* UML
* Atom

## Lessons Learned
I learned to use the capabilities of Enums to make programming more efficient. I also got practice implementing the use of building classes whose fields are objects. Finally, I learned how to use conditionals to their fullest potential in order for me to build the game logic.

## How to improve
I could improve my project by creating a two player mode, allowing the use of double down, and allowing the use of dealing from a multi-deck shoe.
